In the current trend of moving everything into the cloud, cloud-based remote desktops are not an exception. Benchmarking virtual remote desktops for performance optimization requires important consideration for the successful development and deployment planning of virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). Benchmarking user experiance with VDI often proves to be very challenging at cloud scale because of rapid evolution of VDI software architectures and a large number of remote desktops to be managed. 

We presented a paper titled [An Automation Framework for Benchmarking and Optimizing Performance of Remote Desktops in the Cloud][paper-link] introducing a new framework for evaluating VDI performance that has the capabilities of simulating real world VDI workloads and measuring important performance metrics at scale. 

Its design aims to provide facilities to easily automate the performance benchmarking tasks and the flexibility of adapting to changes in VDI software architecture, which are two major limitations of the existing solution. we also present a set of performance results run by of this framework.
